# How to contribute with tests

## Git

1. If you don't have the repo on your machine:
    1. Fork the repository
    2. Clone your repository into your machine
    3. Add remote upstream `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mhorod/oop-unit-tests`

2. Execute `git pull upstream main` to sync changes
3. Create branch for your changes and switch to it
    1. `git branch {branch_name}`
    2. `git checkout {branch_name}`

4. Add your tests to directory `oop-unit-tests/satori/{task}/{name_and_surname}`
5. Commit your changes and push them
6. Go to your repository on Github and create a pull request

## tests
In single java project there can exist only one class of given name. In order to avoid name conflicts prefix your test class with name and surname., e.g. `class JohnDoeTests {}`

Try to make your tests concise and focused on single thing.
Test behavior rather than interface.

If you have many assertions consider splling the test into more functions.

Use `snake_case` for naming test methods and use names that convey expected behavior.
e.g. `size` is a bad name for a test while `size_of_new_list_is_zero` is better.

It will help users of your tests understanding what may be failing.
